Logging Serial output data with Termite [https://www.compuphase.com/software_termite.htm] saves all the measurements into one file.
The individual measurements can then be separated using the split command line tool. 

split -d -l 51203 termite_test_write2buffer_mode.txt data

i.e.

split -d -l <number of lines until next data-set> <name of data file> <output name scaffold>


TO START WITH SPECIFIED NUMBERING:
split --numeric=1 -l 51203 termite_test_write2buffer_mode.txt data.txt
